## About Me

Frontend Engineer working with React, TypeScript, and Next.js. I like code that’s easy to read, easy to change, and doesn’t surprise anyone in production.

Daily **Neovim** user. I care about solid workflows and use **AI-assisted coding** to save time, not to avoid thinking.

Outside of work: rock climbing, biking, and occasional attempts at stoic calm — with varying success.
